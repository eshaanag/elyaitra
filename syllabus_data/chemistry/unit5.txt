Polymers
Polymers are an important class of materials widely used in daily life as well as in advanced
engineering and industrial applications. The term polymer is derived from the Greek words poly
meaning “many” and meros meaning “units”. Thus, a polymer is a high molecular weight
compound formed by the repetition of small structural units known as monomers, which are
chemically bonded together through covalent bonds.
Polymers may be naturally occurring or synthetic. Natural polymers include cellulose, starch,
proteins, and natural rubber, which play vital roles in biological and structural systems. Synthetic
polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, nylon, PVC, and Teflon are produced
industrially and are extensively used due to their low cost, light weight, corrosion resistance, and
ease of processing.
A polymer molecule generally consists of a long-chain structure with repeating units. The
formation of polymers from monomers occurs through a process known as polymerization, which
may take place by different mechanisms. Depending on the mode of polymerization and structure,
polymers exhibit a wide range of physical, chemical, mechanical, and thermal properties.
Polymers can be:


Natural (starch, cellulose, proteins, natural rubber)



Synthetic (polyethylene, PVC, nylon, PVA)



Semi-synthetic (cellulose acetate, rayon)

Types of polymerization
Polymerization is a chemical process in which a large number of small molecules called
monomers combine to form a high molecular weight compound known as a polymer. Based on
the nature of the reaction mechanism, polymerization reactions are broadly classified into addition
polymerization and condensation polymerization.
1. Addition (chain-growth) polymerization
2. Condensation (step-growth) polymerization

1. Addition Polymerization
Addition polymerization is a process in which monomer molecules containing unsaturated bonds
(such as C=C or C≡C) undergo successive addition without the elimination of any small molecules.
The polymer formed has the same empirical formula as the monomer.
This type of polymerization generally occurs through a chain reaction mechanism, which
consists of three steps: initiation, propagation, and termination. The reaction is usually initiated
by free radicals, cations, or anions.
In addition, polymerization, the double bond of the monomer opens up and links with other
monomer units, resulting in a long-chain polymer. Since no by-products are formed, the polymer
yield is very high.
Important examples
Example 1: Polyethylene (PE)


Monomer: ethene (CH₂=CH₂)



Reaction: nCH2=CH2→ –[CH2–CH2]–n



Uses: films, pipes, wire insulation, containers.

Example 2: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)


Monomer: vinyl chloride (CH₂=CHCl)

Example 3: Polystyrene (PS)


Monomer: styrene (C₆H₅–CH=CH₂)



Reaction: n C6H5–CH=CH2→ –[CH2–CH(C6H5)–]n



Uses: packaging, insulation, disposable cups.

2. Condensation Polymerization
Condensation polymerization is a process in which monomers containing two or more functional
groups react with each other to form polymers with the elimination of small molecules such as
water, ammonia, or hydrogen chloride. The repeating units of the polymer differ from the
monomers due to the removal of these small molecules. This type of polymerization proceeds
through a step-growth mechanism, where any two reactive species can combine at any stage of
the reaction. High molecular weight polymers are formed only at high degrees of conversion.
Condensation polymers usually contain functional groups such as ester, amide, or ether linkages
in their backbone.
Example 1: Nylon-12
Nylon-12 is a condensation polymer belonging to the polyamide family. It is prepared by the
polymerization of 12-aminolauric acid or by the ring-opening polymerization of laurolactam.
During polymerization, the amine (–NH₂) and carboxylic acid (–COOH) groups of the monomer
react with each other, forming amide linkages (–CONH–) along the polymer chain with the
elimination of water. Nylon-12 exhibits low moisture absorption, good chemical resistance,
flexibility, and excellent wear resistance. Because of these properties, it is widely used in
automotive fuel lines, tubing, gears, electrical insulation, and biomedical applications.
Example 2: Polylactic Acid (PLA)
Polylactic acid (PLA) is a biodegradable condensation polymer derived from renewable
resources such as corn starch and sugarcane. It is synthesized from lactic acid, which is produced
by the fermentation of carbohydrates.
In PLA formation, lactic acid molecules undergo condensation polymerization, forming ester
linkages (–COO–) with the elimination of water. PLA is a biodegradable and biocompatible
polymer, making it environmentally friendly. It is widely used in packaging materials,
disposable cups, biomedical implants, sutures, and 3D printing filaments.

Nylon-12
Nylon-12 (PA12) is a high-performance engineering thermoplastic polyamide widely used in
automotive, electrical, and 3D-printing applications. It is important to understand both how it is
synthesized and how its structure leads to its distinctive properties.


Nylon-12 is a linear polyamide with 12 carbon atoms in each repeat unit between amide
linkages.



Repeat unit: –NH–(CH₂)₁₁–CO–.



Because the methylene segment is long, the polymer is relatively flexible and hydrophobic
compared with shorter-chain nylons such as nylon-6,6 or nylon-6.

Synthesis of nylon-12
Industrial nylon-12 is mainly made from ω-aminolauric acid or laurolactam (12-membered
cyclic amide). Both routes are examples of condensation (step-growth) polymerization.

Ring-opening polymerization of laurolactam
1. Monomer: laurolactam (also called ω-laurolactam), a 12-membered cyclic amide derived
from ω-aminolauric acid.
2. Mechanism (hydrolytic ring-opening polymerization):
o

A small amount of water and an activator open the ring to give amino-carboxyl
chain ends.

o

The opened species then undergo step-growth polycondensation similar to other
nylons.

3. Industrial practice (conceptual):
o

Melt laurolactam at high temperature (~250–300 °C) under pressure with controlled
water content.

o

After initial “pre-polymerization,” reduce pressure and continue heating to increase
molecular weight by removing water.

o

The resulting polymer melt is extruded into strands, cooled, and pelletized.

Properties of nylon-12
The unusual combination of a long, flexible methylene sequence (11 CH₂ groups) and polar amide
linkages gives nylon-12 a balance of toughness, flexibility, and low moisture uptake.

Thermal and mechanical properties


Melting point: lower than nylon-6 and nylon-6,6 (typically around 175–180 °C), which
makes processing easier.



Glass transition temperature (Tg): relatively low (around –40 to –50 °C), so the polymer
remains flexible at low temperatures.



Mechanical behavior:


Good toughness and impact resistance.



Moderate stiffness and strength; can be reinforced with glass fibres or fillers for
higher modulus.



Good fatigue and creep resistance, useful for pressure tubes and automotive parts.

Chemical and physical properties


Low

water

absorption:

The

long

non-polar

methylene

segment

reduces

hydrogen-bonding with water compared to other nylons, so dimensional stability and
mechanical properties change less with humidity.


Chemical resistance: Good resistance to oils, fuels, hydrocarbons, greases, and many
chemicals, which is important for fuel lines, brake tubing, and pneumatic hoses.



Barrier properties: Reasonable gas and fuel barrier, making nylon-12 suitable for
multi-layer fuel pipes and tanks.



Density: Lower than many engineering plastics, giving weight savings.

Processing and applications


Processing:
o

Thermoplastic: can be processed by injection molding, extrusion, blow molding,
and powder-bed fusion (SLS) 3D printing.

o

Good melt flow; grades are tailored for tubing, films, or powder for additive
manufacturing.



Applications:
o

Automotive: fuel and brake lines, air-brake tubing, cable protection, connectors.

o

Electrical and electronics: flexible conduits, cable sheathing, connectors.

o

Consumer and sports goods: shoe components, flexible housings, tubing.

o

3D printing (SLS/HP-MJF): lightweight functional prototypes and end-use parts,
especially where toughness and fatigue resistance are needed.

Applications of Nylon 12 in 3D printing
Nylon-12 (PA12) is one of the most important engineering plastics for industrial 3D printing,
especially in powder-bed processes like selective laser sintering (SLS) and Multi Jet Fusion (MJF).
It combines high strength, toughness, and chemical resistance with low moisture uptake, which
makes it ideal for functional parts and not just prototypes.

Why nylon-12 works so well in 3D printing


Thermoplastic polyamide: PA12 is a linear polyamide with 12 carbons in the repeat unit,
giving a relatively low melting point (~170–180 °C) and good melt flow, so it can be
processed reliably in SLS/MJF and also as FFF filament.



Mechanical properties: It offers high tensile strength, good elongation at break (so parts
bend before breaking), and excellent impact and fatigue resistance, enabling durable living
hinges, clips, and load-bearing parts.



Low moisture absorption and chemical resistance: Compared to other nylons, PA12
absorbs much less water, so printed parts maintain dimensional accuracy and mechanical
properties even in humid environments; they also resist oils, fuels, and many chemicals.



Powder behavior for SLS/MJF: PA12 powders have very good flow ability and absorb
laser energy efficiently, enabling thin layers, fine detail, and consistent sintering with
minimal warping or shrinkage.

Typical 3D-printing applications of nylon-12


Functional prototypes and low-volume production: Brackets, housings, snap-fits, and
hinges that can be tested under real mechanical loads; PA12’s balance of stiffness and
toughness makes it suitable for “production-like” prototypes and short production runs.



Automotive and aerospace parts: Lightweight, strong components such as clips, ducts,
covers, cable guides, and bracketry that must withstand vibration, fuels, oils, and
temperature cycles.



Medical and personalized devices: Custom braces, orthotics, dental models, and surgical
guides that benefit from PA12’s biocompatibility (for some grades), toughness, and ability
to capture complex geometries.



Consumer products and wearables: Customized phone cases, watch straps, eyewear
frames, and sports gear, where impact resistance, thin-wall capability, and good surface
finish are important.



Composite filaments: Carbon-fiber- or glass-fiber-reinforced PA12 filaments are used in
large-format FFF printing for stiff, lightweight tooling, jigs, fixtures, and structural
components.

Biopolymers: PLA


Biopolymers are polymers produced by living organisms (e.g., polysaccharides, proteins,
nucleic acids) or synthetic polymers derived from renewable resources and designed to be
biodegradable.



PLA is a synthetic biodegradable aliphatic polyester made from lactic acid, which itself
is obtained by fermentation of carbohydrates.



Because PLA can decompose under industrial composting conditions, it is considered an
eco-friendly alternative to conventional petroleum-based plastics like PET and PS in many
applications.

Synthesis of PLA
PLA is produced via two main industrial routes, both starting from lactic acid
(2-hydroxypropionic acid).

1. Direct polycondensation of lactic acid

1. Step 1 – Lactic acid production
o

Sugars from corn, sugarcane, cassava etc. are fermented by lactic acid bacteria to
give lactic acid.

2. Step 2 – Dehydration / polycondensation
o

Lactic acid molecules have both –COOH and –OH groups.

o

Under heat and with catalysts, they undergo condensation, forming ester bonds
and releasing water:
n HO–CH(CH3)–COOH→ –[O–CH(CH3)–CO]n– + nH2O
Process points



Requires removal of water (vacuum, inert gas sweep) to drive the equilibrium
forward.



Achieving high molecular weight only by direct condensation is difficult, so this
route is often combined with chain-extenders or used to make pre-polymers.

Properties of PLA:
Physical and mechanical properties


Density: about 1.24–1.27 g cm⁻³; lighter than many metals but similar to PET.



Glass transition temperature (Tg): ~55–65 °C (for common grades).

Melting temperature (Tm): typically 150–180 °C, depending on stereochemistry and
crystallinity.



Mechanical behavior:
o

Relatively high modulus (stiff) and good tensile strength.

o

More brittle than polyethylene or polypropylene; impact resistance can be limited
unless toughened.

o

Crystallinity and orientation (e.g., in fibers, films) greatly influence stiffness and
clarity.

Thermal and degradation behavior


Thermal stability:

o

Starts to degrade thermally above ~200 °C; careful processing conditions are
needed.

o


Hydrolysis of ester bonds can occur in presence of moisture and heat.

Biodegradability:
o

In industrial composting (high temperature, moisture, microbes), PLA degrades to
lactic acid, then to CO₂ and water.

o

Degradation is slower in normal soil or marine environments; depends strongly on
temperature, pH, and microorganisms.

Barrier and chemical properties


Barrier properties:
o

Better oxygen barrier than polystyrene and similar to PET, but poorer
water-vapour barrier than polyolefins.



Chemical resistance:
o

Good resistance to fats and oils; susceptible to hydrolysis in strong acids/bases
and at elevated temperature.

Applications of PLA
1. Packaging and disposable products


Transparent cups, trays, bottles, thermoformed containers.



Films and bags for food packaging and agricultural mulch films.



Advantages:
o

Clarity and gloss similar to PET.

o

Compostability helps reduce landfill loads when collected properly.

2. Fibers and textiles


PLA fibers used in:
o

Biodegradable nonwovens (diapers, wipes).

o

Clothing, upholstery, and carpets where comfort, low flammability, and
renewable origin are valued.



Can be melt-spun and drawn like conventional polyester fibers.

3. Biomedical field


Excellent biocompatibility and degradation to non-toxic lactic acid make PLA vital in
medicine.



Applications:
o

Resorbable sutures, screws, plates, and pins in orthopedic and dental surgery.

o

Drug-delivery systems (microspheres, nanoparticles, implants) where controlled
degradation releases drug molecules.

o

Tissue engineering scaffolds, often porous structures allowing cell growth and
eventual resorption.

4. 3D printing (Additive manufacturing)


PLA is one of the most common filaments for Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) 3D
printers:



o

Low warping and relatively low processing temperature (~190–220 °C).

o

Odour is mild compared to ABS.

o

Good dimensional accuracy and surface finish.

Used for prototypes, educational models, custom fixtures, and some functional parts not
exposed to high temperature.

5. Blends and composites


PLA is often blended or reinforced to overcome brittleness and improve toughness or
heat resistance:


Blends with PBAT, PCL for flexibility.



Glass-fiber or natural-fiber reinforced PLA for structural applications.



Nanocomposites with clays, graphene, or starch to tune barrier and mechanical
properties.

Conducting Polymers:
Conducting polymers are organic polymers that can conduct electricity like metals or
semiconductors while retaining the processability and flexibility of plastics. Their conductivity
arises from a backbone rich in conjugated double bonds; when this backbone is “doped” (oxidized
or reduced), mobile charge carriers (polarons, bipolarons, solitons) are generated and can move
along and between chains. Typical examples are polyacetylene, polypyrrole, polythiophene, and
polyaniline.

Polyaniline (PANI):
Polyaniline is one of the most important and widely studied conducting polymers because it
combines electrical conductivity with the processability and low cost of conventional plastics.
Chemically, it is obtained by oxidative polymerization of aniline and consists of benzene rings
connected through nitrogen atoms to form a conjugated backbone. This backbone contains
alternating single and double bonds, which create a delocalized π‑electron system; such
conjugation is a prerequisite for electronic conduction in organic materials. Unlike metals,
however, the undoped form of polyaniline (emeraldine base) is only weakly conducting. Its key
advantage is that the conductivity can be tuned over many orders of magnitude simply by changing
its oxidation state and degree of protonation using acids or bases. In acidic media the polymer is
“doped” by protonation of imine nitrogen sites, producing the emeraldine salt form that shows
much higher conductivity due to the formation of mobile charge carriers (polarons and bipolarons).
This reversible doping–dedoping, together with good environmental stability, ease of synthesis in
water at room temperature, and the ability to form films, fibers, coatings, and nanostructures,
makes polyaniline a versatile material for engineering applications including chemical sensors,
electrochromic devices, anticorrosion coatings, electromagnetic interference shielding, and
electrode materials in energy‑storage systems.

Synthesis of PANI:

The image shows the oxidative polymerization of aniline to polyaniline (PANI) in acidic
medium.
First, aniline (C₆H₅–NH₂) is protonated by hydrochloric acid to give anilinium chloride (C₆H₅–
NH₃⁺Cl⁻), with HCl acting as the acid catalyst. Under these conditions, the anilinium ions are then
oxidatively coupled using ammonium persulfate, (NH₄)₂S₂O₈, as the oxidizing agent, typically at
about 0 °C with continuous stirring. During this oxidative polymerization step, anilinium units link
through their para positions via –NH– bridges, producing the conjugated polyaniline chain. The
resulting polymer backbone contains alternating quinoid and benzenoid units, corresponding to
oxidized (quinonoid) and reduced (benzenoid) rings along the chain, which together define the
emeraldine oxidation state of polyaniline.

Conducting Mechanism in PANI:
Electrical conductivity in polyaniline (PANI) originates from its conjugated backbone and the
creation of mobile charged defects during protonic acid doping. In the undoped emeraldine base
form, PANI consists of benzene rings linked through –NH– and –N= groups in an alternating
single–double bond fashion, so π-electrons are present but largely localized; the material behaves
as an insulator or very poor semiconductor. When an acid such as HCl/H2SO4 is added, the imine
nitrogens (–N=) are protonated to –NH⁺– sites, with anions (Cl⁻/HSO4⁻, etc.) situated nearby; this
process does not change the total number of electrons on the chain but reorganizes the electronic

structure and generates radical-cation defects called polarons and, at higher doping levels,
dications called bipolarons.

In the doped emeraldine salt, these polarons and bipolarons are delocalized over several repeat
units and act as the principal charge carriers. Because real PANI is polycrystalline and disordered,
charge transport does not occur through a perfect conduction band but mainly by thermally
activated hopping of these carriers along and between chains, across conducting grains separated
by more resistive regions; this is why conductivity increases strongly with doping level,
crystallinity, and chain alignment, and can be tuned from ~10⁻¹⁰ S cm⁻¹ (undoped) up to ≈10–10²
S cm⁻¹ for well-doped, well-ordered emeraldine salt. In simple, the undoped PANI chain is like a
road with many barriers, while acid doping turns some nitrogen sites into positively charged
“stations” (polarons/bipolarons) that allow charges to hop from one place to another, giving
measurable electrical conductivity.

science and technology (2002): 1-44.

Engineering Applications of PANI:
PANI is a versatile conducting polymer with a wide range of engineering applications because it
combines tunable electrical conductivity, redox activity, environmental stability, and low cost. Its
ability to switch reversibly between insulating and conducting states by simple acid/base or
potential control makes it especially attractive for devices that need sensing, switching, or
energy-storage functions.
1.

Energy storage and conversion


Supercapacitors: PANI is used as an electrode material (often coated on carbon, graphene,
or metal oxides) where its fast, reversible redox reactions contribute high
pseudocapacitance and good power density.



Rechargeable batteries and fuel cells: It can act as a conductive, redox-active component
in cathodes, anodes, and current collectors, improving charge transfer and reducing internal
resistance in systems such as Li-ion, Pb–acid, and metal–air cells.

2. Sensors and biosensors


Gas and chemical sensors: Thin films or nanostructured PANI (nanofibers, nanowires)
change resistance dramatically on exposure to gases like NH₃, HCl, NO₂ or vapors of
organic solvents, enabling chemiresistive sensors for environmental and industrial
monitoring.



pH and ion sensors / biosensors: Because PANI’s conductivity and color depend on
protonation state, it is used in pH electrodes and as a transducer layer in enzyme-based
biosensors (e.g., glucose, cholesterol), where biochemical reactions modulate its
oxidation/doping level.

3. Anticorrosion and protective coatings


Corrosion protection of metals: PANI-based coatings on steel, aluminum and other metals
can passivate the surface and shift the corrosion potential into a more noble region, acting
as a redox buffer and physical barrier.



Conductive primers and paints: Blending PANI with epoxy or polyurethane yields coatings
that both protect against corrosion and provide controlled conductivity, useful for
pipelines, storage tanks, and marine structures.

4. Electrochromic and optoelectronic devices


Electrochromic displays and smart windows: PANI changes color reversibly (yellow ↔
green ↔ blue/violet) with applied potential, enabling low-power display segments,
variable-transmittance windows, and indicators.



Photovoltaics and LEDs (auxiliary layers): It can serve as a hole-transport or buffer layer,
leveraging its work function and processability from solution.

5. EMI shielding, antistatic, and conductive components


EMI shielding materials: PANI-filled plastics, foams, and fabrics absorb and reflect
electromagnetic radiation, protecting electronic equipment from interference.



Antistatic coatings and textiles: Thin PANI layers provide surface conductivity to dissipate
charge on packaging, conveyor belts, clean-room garments, and electronic housings.

6. Actuators, flexible and wearable electronics


Electrochemical actuators (“artificial muscles”): Volume changes during redox/doping
cycles in PANI films or fibers generate mechanical motion, used in micro-actuators and
soft robotic elements.



Flexible/wearable devices: Printable PANI inks and PANI-coated fibers are used for
flexible circuits, strain or motion sensors, and smart textiles where bending stability and
moderate conductivity are required.

Electronic waste (E-waste) management:
Electronic waste, or e-waste, is one of the fastest-growing solid-waste streams worldwide and is
especially relevant for engineers because it couples materials science, electronics, and
environmental management. E-waste refers to any electrical or electronic equipment (EEE) and its
components that have been discarded by the owner as waste, with no intention of further use. This
includes devices that are obsolete, broken, or simply unwanted, whether they are large household
appliances, small gadgets, or complex IT hardware. Unlike ordinary municipal waste, e-waste
contains a concentrated mix of valuable materials (metals, plastics, glass) together with hazardous
substances (heavy metals, flame retardants), so its generation, handling, and recycling require
specialized approaches and regulations.
Sources of E-waste:
The sources of e-waste span the entire life cycle of electronic products. At the primary level,
individual consumers and households generate e-waste when they discard items such as mobile
phones, laptops, televisions, refrigerators, washing machines, and kitchen appliances at the end of
their useful life. Institutional and commercial users—offices, banks, universities, hospitals,
telecommunication companies, data centers, and government departments—are major “bulk
consumers” and dispose of large quantities of computers, servers, networking equipment, medical
electronics, printers, copiers, and laboratory instruments during upgrades or replacement cycles.
Additional sources include manufacturing rejects and off-spec components from electronics
factories, scrap from assembly and repair workshops, and returned or unsold products from
retailers. Together, these streams create a complex and continuous flow of obsolete electronics
into the waste system.
Composition of E-waste:
The composition of e-waste is heterogeneous but can be broadly broken into several material
classes. A large fraction is metals, including base metals such as iron, copper, aluminum, and tin,
and smaller but economically important amounts of precious and special metals such as gold,
silver, palladium, and platinum. Many devices, especially printed circuit boards, also contain
hazardous heavy metals like lead, cadmium, mercury, and hexavalent chromium, which can leach
into soil and water if improperly handled. A second major fraction is polymers and plastics,
ranging from common thermoplastics (ABS, PVC, polycarbonate, polystyrene) used in housings

to epoxy resins in printed circuit boards and polyurethane foams in refrigerators; these often
contain brominated flame retardants and plasticizers that can form toxic emissions when burned.
The third important fraction is glass and ceramics, for example in cathode-ray tubes, display
panels, and certain insulating and structural components; CRT glass may be rich in lead, while
fluorescent lamps and some displays also contain phosphors and small quantities of mercury.
Additionally, e-waste includes composite materials, batteries, capacitors, and cooling agents
(CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs) in older refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment.

Effects of e-waste on environment and human health:
E‑waste affects both the environment and human health because it contains a complex mixture of
toxic and valuable materials. When it is dumped, burned, or recycled in unsafe ways, the hazardous
components (heavy metals, acids, plastics with flame‑retardants, etc.) are released into air, soil,
and water and then enter food chains and the human body.
Effects on the environment
E‑waste often ends up in open dumps or is processed in informal recycling yards where products
are broken or burned to recover metals. In landfills, heavy metals such as lead, mercury, cadmium,
chromium and nickel can leach out of crushed circuit boards, CRT glass, batteries, and switches
into surrounding soil and groundwater. This contamination damages soil fertility, harms soil
microorganisms and plants, and can make water from wells and nearby rivers unsafe for drinking
or irrigation. Open burning of cables, plastics and printed circuit boards to recover copper and
other metals releases dioxins, furans, brominated flame‑retardant by‑products and fine particulate
matter; these pollutants degrade air quality, contribute to smog, and deposit back onto land and
water surfaces far from the original site.
Aquatic ecosystems are also seriously affected. Run‑off from e‑waste dumps carries dissolved
metals and organic toxins into streams, lakes and coastal waters, where they accumulate in
sediments and are taken up by algae, invertebrates, fish and birds. Bioaccumulation and
biomagnification mean that top predators (including humans who eat fish) receive the highest
doses. In addition, greenhouse gases and toxic fumes generated by landfilling and burning
electronics contribute indirectly to climate change and acidification, while physical litter from
discarded devices changes local habitats and can reduce biodiversity around dumping hotspots.

Effects on human health
Human exposure to e‑waste contaminants occurs mainly through inhalation of polluted air,
ingestion of contaminated food and water, and direct skin contact during informal recycling. Lead,
often present in solder and older display glass, can damage the developing brain and nervous
system, causing reduced IQ, behavioral problems, and learning difficulties in children; in adults it
contributes to hypertension, kidney damage and anemia. Mercury from switches, lamps and some
circuit boards affects the central nervous system and can impair vision, coordination and cognitive
function. Cadmium and nickel from batteries and components accumulate in the kidneys and
bones, leading to renal dysfunction and skeletal problems, while hexavalent chromium is a potent
carcinogen.
Workers in informal recycling sites—who may dismantle devices by hand, burn cables, or use acid
leaching without protection—face especially high risks. They inhale smoke containing dioxins,
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and metal fumes, which are linked to chronic cough, bronchitis,
decreased lung function and higher risk of cancers. Skin contact with acids and alkalis used to strip
metals can cause burns and dermatitis. Epidemiological studies near e‑waste hubs report higher
rates of DNA damage, hormonal disruption, reduced lung function, adverse birth outcomes and
impaired neurodevelopment among children living or working there compared with control areas.
Because many of these toxic substances cross the placenta and are found in breast milk, pregnant
women and infants are particularly vulnerable to long‑term effects.

Artificial Intelligence in E-waste management:
Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a powerful tool to make e-waste management more
efficient, safer, and closer to a circular economy. It is mainly applied through machine learning,
computer vision, robotics, and data analytics integrated with sensors and networked systems.
AI systems can be trained to recognize different types of electronic devices and materials (plastics,
metals, printed circuit boards) based on images, sensor signals, or other features. Once trained,
these models guide robots and automated machines to sort, dismantle, and process e-waste with
high speed and accuracy. In addition, AI-driven data analytics can forecast e-waste generation,
optimize logistics for collection, and support decision-making for policymakers and recyclers.

Key applications of AI in E-waste
1. Automated sorting and dismantling
o

Computer-vision models classify e-waste items on conveyor belts and identify
components such as circuit boards, wires, batteries, displays, and plastic housings.

o

Robotic arms controlled by AI pick, separate, and dismantle components, reducing
manual labor and exposure of workers to hazardous substances.

o

Fine-grained recognition (e.g., types of connectors, presence of batteries) improves
material purity and metal recovery rates.

2. Material identification and quality control
o

AI models combine image data with signals from X-ray, infrared, hyperspectral, or
weight sensors to distinguish between different metals (Cu, Al, Fe), plastics, and
glass.

o

This allows precise separation into high-value fractions and contaminated fractions,
supporting high-quality recycling and reducing down-cycling.

3. Smart collection and logistics
o

“Smart bins” equipped with cameras and sensors can detect when e-waste is
deposited, classify items, and send data to centralized systems.

o

AI-based route optimization plans efficient pick-up schedules for collection
vehicles, reducing fuel use and ensuring that e-waste is not left to accumulate or be
scavenged informally.

4. Forecasting and planning
o

Machine-learning models analyze sales data, product lifetimes, repair statistics, and
demographic information to predict future e-waste volumes by type and region.

o

These forecasts help governments and companies plan recycling capacity, design
take-back schemes, and set targets for material recovery.

5. Design for recycling and circular economy
o

By mining large datasets on failure modes and recycling outcomes, AI can give
feedback to manufacturers about which product designs are easier or harder to
disassemble and recycle.

o

This supports eco-design: modular products, standardized fasteners, and materials
that can be recovered with minimal processing.

6. Monitoring environmental and health risks

o

AI-enabled sensor networks can track air quality, heavy-metal levels, and other
indicators around e-waste processing sites.

o

Early-warning systems can alert authorities to unsafe practices such as open
burning or acid leaching in informal sectors.

Direct recycling of lithium from spent lithium-ion batteries
Direct recycling of lithium from spent lithium-ion batteries aims to recover lithium (and often the
cathode material) with minimal chemical transformation, so that it can be reused in new batteries
with lower energy use and waste generation than full hydrometallurgical or pyrometallurgical
routes. Instead of completely dissolving and refining all metals, direct recycling focuses on
selectively extracting lithium or restoring the cathode to a reusable form while preserving the
active material’s structure as much as possible. The process normally starts with safe
pre-treatment: spent cells are electrically discharged, opened, and mechanically shredded or
separated to obtain “black mass,” a powder rich in cathode material (such as LiCoO₂, NCM, NCA,
LFP), anode graphite, binder, and conductive carbon. Subsequent physical separations (screening,
magnetic and density separation) enrich the cathode fraction, which then goes to direct recycling
operations.
In one common direct lithium recovery approach, the cathode powder is subjected to a controlled
thermal or chemical treatment that converts lithium into a selectively leachable compound while
leaving transition metals largely in a solid phase. For example, in reduction-roasting routes, the
mixed oxide cathode is heated with a reductant (such as hydrogen, carbon, or certain salts) so that
LiMO₂ (M = Co, Ni, Mn etc.) is partially reduced and lithium is transformed into a water-soluble
phase like LiOH or Li₂CO₃, whereas cobalt, nickel, and manganese become metallic or remain as
relatively insoluble oxides. A simplified representation for a layered oxide cathode LiMO₂ reduced
in hydrogen can be written as:
LiMO₂ (s) + ½ H₂ (g) → LiOH (s or l) + M Ox_{x}x (s)
followed by water leaching:
LiOH (s) → Li⁺ (aq) + OH⁻ (aq).
Because the transition-metal oxides or metals remain largely undissolved, lithium can be
selectively separated in the leachate and subsequently crystallized as battery-grade LiOH·H₂O or
Li₂CO₃ by evaporation and precipitation. This route is called “direct” in the sense that lithium is
recovered in one or two steps from the cathode without full digestion and multi-stage solvent
extraction.

Another family of direct methods uses mild leaching agents such as deep eutectic solvents,
organic acids, or carbonate systems that preferentially complex Li⁺ over other cations. For
instance, a choline-chloride/oxalic acid medium can leach lithium and cobalt from cathode
powders under relatively low temperatures; with careful control of water content and oxalate
concentration, lithium can precipitate first as lithium oxalate (Li₂C₂O₄), while cobalt remains in
solution and is precipitated later. A generic reaction for the lithium part in such oxalate-based
leaching can be expressed as:
LiMO₂(s) + 2H₂C₂O₄ (aq) → Li₂C₂O₄(s) + M C₂O₄·xH₂O (aq or s) + 2H₂O(l),
then, after separation and calcination,
Li₂C₂O₄ (s) → Li₂CO₃ (s) + CO (g) or CO₂ (g)
(on heating in controlled conditions). Because these systems run at lower temperatures and can
sometimes be regenerated and reused, they are attractive as more sustainable “direct” lithium
recovery options compared with strong-acid leaching.
A stricter meaning of direct recycling in recent literature is “direct regeneration” of cathode
materials, where lithium lost during cycling is replenished without fully breaking down the crystal
structure. In such methods, the spent cathode is mixed with a lithium source such as Li₂CO₃ or
LiOH and heat-treated so that lithium re-enters the lattice, restoring stoichiometry and
electrochemical performance.
Here, lithium is effectively recycled by re-lithiating the existing oxide, and the regenerated cathode
powder can be re-coated and reused in new cells. Although this does not produce a separate lithium
salt product, it is an important direct route that conserves both lithium and the higher-value cathode
framework.

Extraction of Gold from E-waste by Bioleaching Method
Electronic waste such as printed circuit boards (PCBs), mobile phones, computers, and electronic
components contains valuable metals like gold (Au), copper (Cu), silver (Ag), and nickel (Ni).
Conventional methods for gold extraction involve toxic chemicals like cyanide, which cause
serious environmental pollution. Bioleaching is an eco-friendly and sustainable alternative that
uses microorganisms to dissolve base metals and liberate gold.
Principle of Bioleaching
Bioleaching is based on the ability of acidophilic bacteria to oxidize metal sulfides or base metals
into soluble forms. The removal of base metals surrounding gold helps in the liberation of gold,
which can later be recovered by chemical methods.
Common microorganisms used:


Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans



Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans



Leptospirillum ferrooxidans

Steps Involved in Bioleaching of Gold from E-waste
1. Pretreatment of E-waste
E-waste is:


Collected



Shredded or crushed



Treated to remove plastics and resins

This increases the surface area and exposes metal components.
2. Bioleaching Process
The crushed E-waste is placed in a bioleaching reactor or heap containing a bacterial culture under
controlled conditions (pH 1.5–2.5, temperature 30–40 °C).

The bacteria oxidize Fe²⁺ to Fe³⁺ and sulfur compounds to sulfuric acid, which dissolves base
metals like Cu, Ni, and Fe.

3. Liberation of Gold
Since gold is chemically inert, it does not dissolve during bioleaching. After removal of
surrounding base metals, gold becomes free (liberated) from the e-waste matrix.
4. Gold Recovery
Liberated gold is recovered using conventional methods such as cyanidation or adsorption
techniques.
