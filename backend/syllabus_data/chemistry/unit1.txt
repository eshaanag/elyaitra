Introduction
Electrochemistry deals with the interaction of matter and electrical energy i.e., producing
electrical energy from chemical reaction (spontaneous process) or bringing out chemical
reactions by applying electrical energy (non-spontaneous process). A device used for
producing an electrical energy from a chemical reaction (redox reaction) is called an
electrochemical cell.
(or)
It is the branch of chemistry, which deals with the study of inter-conversion of electrical energy
into chemical energy that takes place through oxidation reduction reactions.

Electrochemistry plays a crucial role in understanding how electrical energy can drive the chemical
changes (electrolysis) and how chemical reactions can generate electricity (galvanic/voltaic cells).

Key Terminology
Oxidation: Loss of electrons
Reduction: Gain of electrons
Redox Reaction: A reaction involving both oxidation and reduction simultaneously.
Electrochemical Cell: A device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy (galvanic cell)
or electrical energy into chemical energy (electrolytic cell).

Anode: Electrode where oxidation occurs.
Cathode: Electrode where reduction occurs.
Electrolyte: A substance that conducts electricity by producing ions in solution or molten state.
Cell Potential (EMF) : The potential difference between two electrodes, which drives the flow of
electrons.
Electrode potential: The potential difference developed between a metal electrode and the solution
of its ions when the electrode is immersed in the solution.
The tendency of the electrode to gain or lose electrons.
For example, when a zinc electrode is placed in a zinc sulfate solution, a potential difference is
established due to charge buildup
A higher potential means the electrode has a stronger tendency to gain electrons (reduction).
A lower potential means the electrode has a stronger tendency to lose electrons (oxidation).
So, cell potential (Ecell/ EMF) is just the voltage difference between two electrodes, which drives
the flow of electrons.

EMF/ Ecell = Ecathode - Eanode
The electrical double layer is just a thin "layer of charges" formed at the boundary between a solid
and a liquid due to attraction of opposite charges.

Key Engineering Applications of Electrochemistry
Energy Systems: Batteries, Fuel Cells, Supercapacitors
Corrosion Engineering: To understand metal corrosion and prevention methods
Electroplating: Coating with Cr, Ni, Au for corrosion resistance and aesthetics.
Environmental Engineering: Wastewater treatment. Removal of pollutants etc.
Sensors: Electrochemical sensors for detecting heavy metals, gases, and organics.
Future Engineering Directions: Green Hydrogen; Recyclable batteries, Smart Grids

Nernst Equation (Overview)
Nernst equation connects thermodynamics, equilibrium, and electrochemistry in one
simple relation.
The Nernst equation relates the electrode potential of a cell to the standard electrode
potential, temperature, the number of electrons involved in the redox reaction, and the
concentrations (or pressures) of reactants and products.
For a general reaction:

𝐸𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙 = 𝐸 ∘ −

where:

0.0591
𝑛

log 𝑄

𝐸 = electrode potential at given conditions
𝐸 ∘ = standard potential

𝑛 = number of electrons transferred
𝑄 = reaction quotient
Standard Electrode Potential (E°): measured under standard conditions (1 M, 1
atm, 25°C).
TYPES OF ELECTRODES

•
•

Electrodes can be defined as a conductor through which electricity enters or leaves an object.
The two common terms we hear in electrode systems is cathode and anode.
The anode is the electrode where electricity moves into.
The cathode is the electrode where electricity is given out or flows out.
Electrodes can be classified into many types and among all the major are;

1. Metal/Metal ion electrode (M/Mn+)
When a metal is immersed in its own salt solution such type of electrode is called
metal/metal ion electrode is formed. Eg: Zn/Zn2+, Cu/ Cu2+
In general M/Mn+
The electrode reaction is Mn+ + ne− → M
Electrode potential depends on the logarithmic concentration of metal ion.
2. Gas Electrode
The gas is bubbled around an inert metal like platinum which is immersed in a solution containing ions
of the same gas. Eg: Hydrogen electrode or SHE, chlorine electrode. Electrode potential depends on
the logarithmic concentration of the ion and the pressure at which the gas is bubbled.

3. Metal insoluble metal salt/ common ion electrode
The metal (M) is covered with an insoluble metal salt (MX) is in contact with a solution
containing an anion of the insoluble metal salt (X).
Eg: Calomel electrode (Hg/Hg2Cl2/Cl−), silver-silver chloride electrode (Ag/AgCl/Cl−)
4. Redox electrode
In this electrode, an inert metal is immersed in a solution containing ions of the same
metal having two different oxidation states. Eg: Pt/Fe2+/Fe3+
Reaction: Fe2+→Fe3+
Electrode potential is the Ratio of logarithmic concentration of all ionic species involved in the redox
reaction.
5. Ion selective electrode
In this type, the sensing part of the electrode is usually made of an ion-specific
membrane. The membrane can be glass membrane, crystalline membrane and ion-exchange resin
membrane. Eg: Glass electrode.
Reference electrodes
Reference electrodes are the electrodes whose potential is known, stable and used for the
determination of potential of unknown electrodes.
Note: Types of reference electrodes:
Primary reference electrode:
Whose potential is fixed as zero. Example: Standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).
Limitations of SHE
It’s difficult to transport.
It's difficult to construct and maintain.
It's difficult to maintain the pressure of H2 gas and concentration of the acid solution like HCl.
It's difficult to get pure hydrogen gas.
Impurities in H2 and HCl spoil ideal platinum electrodes.
Secondary reference electrode:
Whose potential is calculated by connecting to the SHE. Secondary reference electrodes have several
advantages over SHE. These electrodes are commonly used for determining the electrode potentials
of other metals. The two commonly used secondary reference electrodes are calomel electrode and
silver-silver electrode.
• Secondary reference electrodes are easier to make and maintain than the SHE.
• Secondary reference electrodes can be used with greater accuracy than the SHE.
• Secondary reference electrodes have a stable, known potential that doesn't change over time.
• Secondary reference electrodes are chemically and electrochemically reversible.

Calomel Electrode
Construction:
1. The calomel electrode’s structure consists of an outer glass tube that
is fitted with a frit at the bottom, which permits electrical contact with
a solution outside the electrode.
2. An inner tube is placed inside an outer tube. The bottom of the inner
tube has glass wool to provide an electrical contact between the
contents of both tubes.
3. Mercury paste is packed on the innermost tube, with mercurous
chloride being dispersed in a saturated potassium chloride solution.
4. The calomel electrode is represented as, Hg /Hg2Cl2/ ClWorking:
Calomel electrode behaves as anode or cathode depending upon the nature of another
electrode. The half-cell reaction when it acts as an anode is
2𝐻𝑔 + 2𝐶𝑙− → 𝐻𝑔2𝐶𝑙2 + 2𝑒−

The half-cell reaction when it acts as a cathode is
𝐻𝑔2𝐶𝑙2 + 2𝑒− → 2𝐻𝑔 + 2𝐶𝑙−

The electrode reaction is,

The potential of calomel electrode is measured with respect to SHE and it depends on
concentration of KCl solution used. The calomel electrode potential is depending on the
concentration of chloride ions in KCl. If the Concentration of chloride ions increases, the
potential decreases and vice versa. (The potential of calomel is inversely proportional to the
concentration of chloride ions)

Concentration cells– Introduction, construction and working
Concentration cells can be defined as electrochemical cells that consist of two half-cells wherein the
electrodes are the same, but they vary in concentration. As the cell strives to reach equilibrium, the
more concentrated half-cell is diluted, and the half-cell of lower concentration has its concentration
increased via the transfer of electrons between these two half cells. Therefore, as the cell moves
towards chemical equilibrium, a potential difference is created.
Potential difference arises due to difference in electrolyte concentration.
Types of Concentration Cells
Concentration cells can be classified into two types, namely:
Electrode Concentration Cells: Contain identical solutions as electrolytes but half-cells differ in the
concentration of the electrode
An Example for this type of cell would be a cell consisting of two hydrogen electrodes which are
subjected to varying pressures but are immersed in the same solutions (containing hydrogen ions).
Electrolyte Concentration Cells: These cells consist of identical electrodes immersed in the
solutions of the same electrolytes but with varying concentrations. In these cells, the electrolyte tends
to diffuse from higher concentration solutions towards solutions of lower concentration.
An example for this type of cell is a cell where the anode consists of Zn/Zn2+(0.01M) whereas the
cathode consists of Zn2+(0.1M)/Zn.
Construction:
The concentration cell is a type of galvanic cell where the half-cells consist of the same substance but
at different concentrations. These cells give a small potential difference while moving towards
chemical equilibrium which can be measured using a voltmeter.
Ex: The anode consists of Cu/Cu2+(0.001M) whereas the cathode consists of Cu2+(0.1M)/Cu. In this
cell, the flow of electrons from the anode to the cathode is due to the reduction of Cu2+ ions at the
cathode into metallic copper.

Sensors – Introduction
We can see many types of sensors available around us, in our ofﬁces, gardens, shopping malls,
homes, cars, toys etc. Sensors are helping us in our everyday lives…
For instance, in our refrigerator, sensors help to maintain the cold temperature and turn on the
light when you open the door.

Definition: A sensor is a device that measures the physical phenomenon and converts into an
electrical signal.
Ex., Eyes, ears, and nose are all different types of sensors.

Main Components of a Sensor:

A sensor consists of three main components

(i) The sensing unit contains the sensor itself which is based on a particular technology.
(ii) The processing circuitry converts the physical variable into an electrical variable.
(iii) The signal output contains the electronics connected to a control system.

Smart Sensors
•

Smart sensors are simply sensors with microprocessors attached to them.

•

They take information from the physical environment and use embedded microprocessors to
monitor, examine and maintain various systems.

Smart sensors have four main functions
Measurement: Simply collect the physical information and converts into electrical
signals. For ex., temperature, pressure etc.,

Configuration: Microprocessors set the operating properties of a smart sensor system, such as
bias voltage or temperature.

Verification: Smart sensors can perform self-diagnosis by looking for signs of errors in internal
signals.

Communication: Smart sensors can communicate with external devices and the cloud.
The features of the smart sensor are; self-identification, smart calibration and
compensation, multi-sensing capacity, sensor communication for configuration of remote &
remote monitoring etc.

Smart Sensor Working Principle
Smart sensors work by capturing data from physical environments & changing their physical
properties like speed, temperature, pressure, mass, or presence of humans into readable electrical
signals.
Usually, a smart sensor will have both transducer and actuator, in which transduce collects data
from physical environment and then actuator performs the programmed function on that data. A
simple example is shown below

Instrumentation of conductometry and its application in the estimation of mixture
of acids?
• Conductance is a measure of how easily electricity (current) flows through a material
or solution. It is reciprocal of resistance.
• If resistance (R) tells us how much a material opposes current, then conductance (C)
tells us how much it allows current.
C=1/R = Ω-1 or mho or siemen
• The Conductance of the solution is explained by considering ohm’s law.
• According to ohm’s law the current flowing through the conductor is directly
proportional to voltage and inversely proportional to the resistance.
I = V/R
• If you increase voltage across a conductor → current increases. If you increase
resistance of the conductor → current decreases.
Principle
Conductometric sensors work on the principle of ionic conductivity of a solution.
The electrical conductivity depends on the concentration, mobility, and charge of ions
in the medium.
When current (AC) is applied across two electrodes immersed in the solution, the ionic
species carry current. The measured conductance (C) is directly proportional to the ionic
concentration.
Instrumentation: It consists of two
platinum electrodes each of unit area of
cross section placed at unit distance
apart. The electrodes are dipped in the
electrolytic solution taken in a beaker.
It is connected to a conductometer to
measure the conductance.
The conductance is measured after the
addition of the titrant at intervals of 0.5 mL

Application of Conductometric titration
It is used in the estimation of acids and bases present in the sample solutions. The
possible combinations and conductance responses are explained below,
Mixture of acids (strong & weak acid) v/s strong base
HCl, CH3COOH v/s NaOH
The strong acid like HCl is titrated against a strong base such as NaOH, the conductance
first decreases due to replacement of fast-moving H+ ions by slow moving Na+ ions
HCl + NaOH

NaCl + H2O

The weak acid do not get neutralized initially because of the well-known common ion
effect.
In the presence of excess of H+ ions, the ionization of the weak acid is suppressed and
hence, weak acid like CH3COOH ionizes gradually after the first end point and the
available H+ ions are neutralized giving the second end point. Because of common ion
effect dissolution of acetic acid is suppressed. Hence it does not provide H + ions which
are required for neutralization.
After the neutralization point of HCl, CH3COOH, conductivity rapidly rises with further
addition of NaOH because of continuous addition of fast moving OH- ions. A plot of
conductance against the volume of base added is shown in the figure. The point of
intersection of two curves gives the neutralization point.
Advantages:
• Mixture of acid can be titrated
• Indicators are not used
• Very weak acids can be titrated
• Can be used with colored solution
