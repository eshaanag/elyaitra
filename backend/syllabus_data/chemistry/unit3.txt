Module 3: Solar Cells
Solar cells, also known as photovoltaic (PV) cells, are semiconductor devices that convert
sunlight directly into electricity using the photovoltaic effect. They are the fundamental
building blocks of solar panels and are widely used in renewable energy systems due to their
ability to generate clean, sustainable power from sunlight. The photovoltaic effect was first
observed in the 19th century, but the first practical solar cell was developed in 1954 by
researchers at Bell Laboratories. Since then, solar cell technology has evolved rapidly, with
multiple generations of cells developed to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and expand
applications. Solar cells are now a cornerstone of global efforts to transition to renewable
energy sources, helping to mitigate climate change and reduce dependence on fossil fuels.

First Generation Solar Cells
First generation solar cells are the oldest and most commercially mature type of photovoltaic
technology. They are primarily based on crystalline silicon (c-Si), which comes in two main
forms: monocrystalline and polycrystalline silicon. These cells are made by slicing wafers from
large silicon ingots, which are grown in highly controlled environments.




Monocrystalline Silicon (m-Si): Made from a single crystal structure, these cells offer
high efficiency (typically 15–24%) and long service life, but are more expensive to
produce.
Polycrystalline Silicon (p-Si): Composed of multiple silicon crystals, these cells are less
efficient (typically 10–18%) but are cheaper and easier to manufacture.

First generation solar cells are known for their high efficiency, stability, and long lifespan,
making them the most widely used technology in the solar industry, accounting for over 80%
of global solar panel installations. However, their main drawbacks include high manufacturing
costs and relatively complex production processes.

Second Generation Solar Cells
Second generation solar cells, commonly known as thin-film solar cells, are made by depositing
one or more very thin layers of photovoltaic materials onto substrates such as glass, plastic, or
metal. These layers are typically only a few nanometers to micrometers thick, which is much
thinner than the wafers used in conventional first-generation crystalline silicon solar cells. The
thin-film construction reduces material use and allows for flexible and lightweight solar panels,
which can be applied in new ways such as building-integrated photovoltaics and semitransparent coatings.
The main types of second generation thin-film solar cells include:






Amorphous Silicon (a-Si): Uses non-crystalline silicon with a band gap of about 1.7
eV. It is less efficient (around 5-12%) compared to crystalline silicon but cheaper, uses
less material, and offers high absorption coefficients. Its lifetime is typically about 15
years. It is non-toxic and widely available but has lower efficiency and issues with
carrier lifetime.
Cadmium Telluride (CdTe): A chalcogenide semiconductor with a direct band gap
around 1.45 eV, CdTe cells are popular due to their low production cost, high
absorption, and efficiency in the 9-16% range commercially. They have a lifespan of
about 20 years. However, the toxicity of cadmium and the scarcity of tellurium are
environmental and scalability concerns. CdTe holds about 5% of global PV production
and is prominent in large-scale utility solar.
Copper Indium Gallium Selenide (CIGS): These cells have a direct band gap (~1.7 eV)
and reach efficiencies up to around 20%. CIGS cells can be flexible and use less
material but are more expensive and have stability issues. Their lifespan is around 12
years. CIGS technology is promising but less mature than CdTe and amorphous silicon.

Second generation thin-film solar cells generally have lower efficiency than first generation
silicon cells but offer lower manufacturing costs, flexibility, and novel application possibilities.
Some thin-film cells, like GaAs-based, can have efficiencies above 29% in research contexts,
competing with or exceeding first-generation efficiencies, but these are often considered
advanced or third-generation innovations.

Third Generation Solar Cells
Third generation solar cells represent advanced, emerging photovoltaic technologies designed
to surpass the efficiency and cost limitations of first and second generation solar cells. These
technologies aim to break beyond the Shockley-Queisser limit for single-junction cells by using
novel materials, innovative device architectures, and new mechanisms for light absorption and
charge conversion.
Key types of third generation solar cells include:
Perovskite Solar Cells: These use hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite materials with a general
formula ABX3, where 'A' is often an organic cation, 'B' is typically lead or tin, and 'X' is a
halide ion. Perovskite cells have rapidly progressed to certified efficiencies above 25%, rivaling
and sometimes exceeding second generation thin-film cells. They can be fabricated using lowcost solution processes but face challenges in long-term stability and toxicity concerns due to
lead content.
Organic Photovoltaics (OPVs): These use organic semiconducting polymers or small
molecules to absorb sunlight and generate charges. OPVs offer the advantages of low-cost
manufacturing, mechanical flexibility, and tunable absorption but typically have lower
efficiencies (around 10-15%) and shorter lifetimes than inorganic cells.
Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs): These cells use a photosensitive dye to capture sunlight
and create electron-hole pairs, often combined with a semiconductor such as titanium dioxide.
DSSCs are low-cost, flexible, and perform well in low-light, but their efficiency (around 711%) and long-term stability are limited.
Quantum Dot Solar Cells: These use semiconductor nanocrystals (quantum dots) that have
size-tunable optical properties, enabling multiple exciton generation and enhanced light
absorption. This technology is still largely at the research stage.
Multi-junction and Tandem Cells: These stack multiple semiconductor layers with different
bandgaps to capture a broader spectrum of sunlight, significantly increasing efficiency. Tandem
cells combining silicon with perovskites have reached efficiencies exceeding 34%.

Advantages of third generation solar cells include potential high efficiency, low-cost solution
processing, mechanical flexibility, and material abundance. However, their challenges center
around stability, scalability, and environmental impacts (notably in perovskites).

Construction and working of Photovoltaic cell for solar cell applications
(Example: Silica solar cell).

Silica solar cells generally refer to solar cells made from silicon, as silicon is
derived from silica (silicon dioxide, SiO2), the abundant material found in sand
and quartz. Silicon solar cells are the fundamental and most widely used
photovoltaic cells in solar energy applications worldwide.
Silicon, obtained by refining silica, is processed into highly pure crystalline form
known as solar-grade silicon, essential for efficient photovoltaic operation. These
cells work on the principle of the p-n junction in silicon, where controlled doping
with elements like boron and phosphorus creates an internal electric field
facilitating charge separation when exposed to sunlight.
Silicon solar cells are typically categorized into monocrystalline and
polycrystalline types. Monocrystalline cells are fabricated from a single
continuous crystal lattice, offering higher efficiencies often between 15% and
24%, while polycrystalline cells, made from multiple smaller crystals, provide a
less expensive but slightly lower efficiency alternative.
The construction of silicon solar cells involves slicing thin wafers from purified
silicon ingots, texturing the surface to reduce reflection and enhance light
absorption, doping to create p-n junction layers, applying anti-reflective coatings,
and depositing metal contacts for charge collection. Encapsulation protects the
delicate structure from environmental damage, enabling durability and extended
operational life.

Silicon solar cells dominate the solar market because of their well-established
manufacturing processes, material abundance (silicon is the second most
abundant element in Earth's crust), relatively high efficiency, and long lifespan.
Despite emerging materials like perovskites, silicon-based cells remain the
bedrock of the photovoltaic industry, balancing cost and performance effectively.
Construction of silica solar cells:
The construction of a silicon solar cell begins with the extraction and purification
of silicon, the most abundant semiconductor material used in photovoltaics.
Silicon is derived from silica (SiO2) found in quartz sand, which is processed in
an electric arc furnace through carbon arc welding to remove oxygen and produce
molten silicon. This metallurgical-grade silicon is about 99% pure, which is
insufficient for solar cell applications, so it undergoes further refinement by the
floating zone technique, which removes remaining impurities by moving a heated
zone through the silicon and segregating impurities. Following purification, the
Czochralski method is used to grow large, cylindrical monocrystalline silicon
ingots by dipping a seed crystal into molten silicon and slowly extracting it while
rotating, allowing the formation of a highly ordered crystal structure.
Alternatively, polycrystalline silicon ingots are manufactured through directional
solidification but have grain boundaries affecting efficiency.

After texturing, the next critical step is doping to create the p-n junction. The
wafer base is usually p-type silicon doped with boron atoms, introducing positive
charge carriers (holes). The surface layer is doped with phosphorus atoms to
create the n-type region containing excess electrons. This is typically achieved by
exposing the wafer to phosphorus-containing gases in a diffusion furnace at

around 900°C for several minutes, allowing phosphorus atoms to penetrate and
form a thin n-type layer on top of the p-type base. The p-n junction formed at this
interface gives rise to an electric field, fundamental to charge separation during
illumination.
Following doping, an anti-reflective coating (ARC), usually silicon nitride
(Si3N4), is deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD).
This thin layer reduces surface reflection from about 30% to less than 10%,
allowing more sunlight to enter the cell. The ARC also passivates the surface by
reducing electronic defects where electron-hole recombination could occur,
thereby boosting the cell’s performance. The front side of the wafer is then
metallized with fine silver grid lines printed through screen printing to collect the
photogenerated electrons while minimizing shading losses. The entire rear
surface is coated with a full layer of aluminum to collect holes and complete the
electrical circuit.
Finally, the individual solar cells are encapsulated within ethylene-vinyl acetate
(EVA) sheets and laminated between a protective tempered glass front and a
durable backsheet polymer, along with an aluminum frame for mechanical
strength. The encapsulation protects the cells from moisture, physical damage,
and environmental conditions during field operation. A junction box attached to
the back facilitates external electrical connections.
Working of silica solar cells:
The working principle hinges on the photovoltaic effect occurring within the
silicon p-n junction. When sunlight, composed of photons, strikes the silicon
surface, the anti-reflective coating and textured surface ensure maximum photon
absorption. Photons with energy equal to or exceeding silicon’s bandgap (about
1.1 eV) excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, liberating
free electrons and creating corresponding holes. These electron-hole pairs are
generated throughout the silicon wafer.
The built-in electric field at the p-n junction separates these charge carrier’s
electrons are driven toward the n-type surface while holes move into the p-type
base. This separation prevents recombination and maintains a flow of charges.
Electrons collected at the front silver grid contacts flow through the external
circuit, powering connected devices or feeding into inverters or batteries. The
current completes its path by returning through the back aluminum contact to the
p-type region, maintaining electrical neutrality.

Each silicon solar cell typically produces an open-circuit voltage around 0.5 to
0.6 volts, with current magnitude depending on the surface area and sunlight
intensity. Multiple cells are wired in series and parallel to form modules and
arrays achieving desired voltage and current levels. The entire system converts
solar energy directly into clean, renewable direct current electricity without
moving parts or emissions, representing a core technology in sustainable energy
solutions. This comprehensive construction and working process enable silicon
solar cells to achieve operational efficiencies ranging from 15% to over 24% in
commercial applications, balancing cost, performance, and durability, making
them the most prevalent photovoltaic technology globally.

Introduction to perovskite, DSSCs and QDSSCs solar cells.
Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs): Perovskite solar cells use a class of materials
with the crystal structure ABX3, typically hybrid organic-inorganic lead halide
compounds like methylammonium lead iodide. These materials serve as the lightabsorbing layer that effectively captures sunlight due to their high absorption
coefficient and excellent charge-carrier mobility. When light hits the perovskite
layer, electron-hole pairs are generated and rapidly separated; electrons move
toward an electron transport layer (e.g., TiO2), and holes move toward a hole
transport layer (e.g., Spiro-OMeTAD). The separated charges are then collected
by electrodes to produce electricity. PSCs offer advantages such as low-cost,
solution-processable fabrication, thin and lightweight layers, and rapidly rising
efficiencies reaching over 26% for single-junction cells and near 35% in
tandem configurations with silicon. Despite their promise, challenges remain
in stability and scalability.
Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs): DSSCs consist of a porous layer of
titanium dioxide (TiO2) coated with a photosensitive dye that absorbs sunlight.
When photons energize the dye molecules, electrons are injected into the TiO 2
conduction band, while the dye molecules become oxidized. The electrons move
through the semiconductor to the electrode, creating current, while the dye
molecules are regenerated by an electrolyte containing a redox mediator. DSSCs
are known for their relatively low manufacturing cost, good performance under
diffuse light conditions, and ease of fabrication on flexible substrates. However,
their efficiency (typically 7–11%) and long-term stability are lower compared to
silicon cells.
Quantum Dot Sensitized Solar Cells (QDSSCs): Similar in concept to DSSCs,
QDSSCs use semiconductor quantum dots as sensitizers instead of dyes.
Quantum dots are nanoscale crystals with size-tunable optical properties,
enabling manipulation of absorption spectra and potential for multiple exciton
generation, which can boost photocurrents. QDSSCs generate electron-hole pairs
upon light absorption by the quantum dots, followed by electron injection into
TiO2 and charge transport through the cell. QDSSCs hold promise for future highefficiency, low-cost solar technologies but are still largely in the research and
development phase due to challenges related to stability and efficient charge
separation.

Perovskite solar cells
Perovskite solar cells are an innovative class of thin-film photovoltaics that employ a
perovskite-structured compound, typically a hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide, as the lightabsorbing active layer. The term "perovskite" refers to the unique crystal structure shared by
these materials, which enables exceptional light absorption and efficient charge transport
properties.
Perovskite refers to both a specific mineral (calcium titanium oxide, CaTiO₃) and a broader
class of materials that share its unique crystal structure. In the context of solar cells and
advanced materials, "perovskite" describes any compound with the general formula ABX₃,
where "A" and "B" are cations of different sizes and "X" is an anion (often oxygen or a halide).
The perovskite structure is typically a nearly cubic lattice:


The “A" cation sits at the center of the cube.



The "B" cation occupies the corners.



The "X" anion (like O²⁻, Cl⁻, I⁻, or Br⁻) is positioned at the face centers or forms an
octahedral cage around the "B" site.

This geometric arrangement gives perovskite materials their impressive electrical, optical, and
structural properties, making them highly versatile for applications such as solar cells,
superconductors, and catalysts.
These solar cells are attracting significant
interest in the scientific and industrial
communities due to their combination of
high-power conversion efficiency, ease of
fabrication, and potential for low production
costs. Since their introduction in 2009 with
modest
efficiencies,
laboratory-scale
perovskite solar cells have rapidly advanced,
now achieving efficiencies exceeding 25% in
single-junction devices, and even higher
values in tandem configurations with silicon.
This rapid progress, along with the versatility
to manufacture lightweight, flexible, and semi-transparent solar modules, positions perovskite
solar cells as a promising technology for next-generation solar energy conversion.
Despite their advantages, the widespread adoption of perovskite solar cells faces challenges,
including stability, scalability, and the use of toxic elements such as lead. Research is ongoing
to overcome these limitations and realize the potential of perovskite materials in practical
photovoltaic applications.
Perovskite solar cells are constructed using layers of specialized materials, with their working
based on the photovoltaic effect converting sunlight into electricity through the separation
and movement of charge carriers.

e−CB + h+VB

Electrons move from the conduction band (CB) to the ETL, holes move from the valence
band (VB) to the HTL. The movement of these separated charge carriers generates electric
current.

Power Alcohol
Power alcohol is a fuel blend typically consisting of 80% petrol and 20% ethanol. Sometimes,
a small amount of benzene is added to improve mixing and performance. Ethanol for power
alcohol is produced via fermentation of sugar or starch rich feedstocks such as molasses, grains,
or biomass.


Power alcohol is used in internal combustion engines to reduce fossil fuel consumption
and emissions.



It has a higher octane number (~90), enhances engine performance, and provides good
anti-knocking properties.
For your references;
Octane number is a measure of a fuel’s ability to resist knocking during
combustion in a spark-ignition engine (like petrol engines).
What is “knocking”?
Knocking happens when the fuel–air mixture in an engine ignites prematurely
due to high pressure and temperature.
This causes:




Reduced engine efficiency
Noise
Possible engine damage

A fuel with a higher octane number resists this premature ignition better.


The lower calorific value (≈7000 kcal/kg) compared to petrol is offset by cleaner
combustion and renewability.



The use of ethanol in fuels decreases dependence on imported oil and promotes
agricultural industries.

Chemistry and Properties


Ethanol (C₂H₅OH) in power alcohol absorbs traces of water in petrol and helps cleaner
fuel burning.



The mixture’s properties include better combustion, reduced carbon monoxide
emissions, and savings in foreign currency for countries importing petroleum.



Ethanol addition increases the compression ratio and can provide up to 10% more
power compared to gasoline alone.

Fermentation Processes for Bioethanol
Bioethanol is produced by fermenting sugars or starches using yeast under anaerobic
conditions:
Steps:
1. Preparation of Feedstock: Raw materials like wheat, corn, or sugarcane are cleaned
and milled to release starch components.
2. Conversion to Sugars: Enzymes (such as amylase) hydrolyze starch into fermentable
sugars (mainly glucose).
3. Fermentation: Yeast (usually Saccharomyces cerevisiae) converts glucose into
ethanol and carbon dioxide:
Yeast

C6H12O6 →

2C2H5OH+2CO2

This process occurs under anaerobic conditions at 30–35°C.
4. Distillation and Rectification: Ethanol is separated from the fermentation mixture
(“mash”) and purified by distillation. The process achieves bioethanol purities up to
99.7 vol.%.
5. Dehydration: Residual water is removed, often using agents like zeolites or molecular
sieves.
6. Byproduct Management: The solid and liquid residues (“stillage”) can be processed
into livestock feed or other bioproducts.
Alternative Feedstocks: Lignocellulosic biomass (wood, straw) also can be converted into
bioethanol via pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis to sugars, and fermentation, though this
process is more complex and technologically demanding.

Advantages of Power Alcohol


Cost Effective: Power alcohol is generally cheaper than petrol, making it an
economically attractive alternative fuel for internal combustion engines.



Improved Octane Number and Performance: The addition of ethyl alcohol to petrol
increases the fuel’s octane number (up to about 90), resulting in enhanced anti-knocking
properties and allowing engines to operate at higher compression ratios. This can lead
to up to 10% more power than petrol alone.



Complete Combustion and Lower Emissions: Ethanol contains oxygen, which
promotes more complete combustion of fuel inside the engine. This helps to reduce
harmful emissions like carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and particulates compared to
pure gasoline. The fuel burns cleaner and is environmentally friendly.



Moisture Absorption: If any moisture is present in the petrol, power alcohol absorbs
it, preventing issues associated with water contamination in fuel systems.



Renewable and Domestic Production: Ethanol for power alcohol is primarily
produced through the fermentation of renewable resources like molasses, grains, or
biomass. This reduces dependence on fossil fuels and foreign oil imports, and supports
domestic agriculture and industry.



Boosts Rural Economy: The use and production of ethanol benefit local farmers and
promote indigenous manufacturing, providing economic advantages to agricultural
sectors.

Biodiesel
Biodiesel is a renewable, environmentally friendly fuel produced from natural oils or fats (such
as vegetable oils, animal fats, or waste cooking oil) via chemical conversion. Its adoption helps
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on fossil diesel in transportation and industrial
systems. Biodiesel can be used directly in diesel engines or blended with petroleum diesel,
especially in compression ignition engines.

Transesterification Reactions for Biodiesel Production
Transesterification is the primary chemical process used for converting oils and fats
(triglycerides) into biodiesel and glycerol. It involves reacting triglycerides with an alcohol,
usually methanol or ethanol, in the presence of a catalyst (base, acid, or enzyme).


Chemical Equation:



Process Steps:
o

Mixing oil with alcohol and catalyst (usually NaOH, KOH, or sulfuric acid).

o

Carrying out the reaction usually under moderate temperatures (50–60°C) for
1–2 hours.

o

Separation of biodiesel from glycerol, followed by purification.

o

Alternative methods include acid catalysis for high free fatty acid content oils
and supercritical or enzymatic catalysis for difficult feedstocks.



Feedstocks: Commonly used oils include soybean, palm, rapeseed, sunflower, and
even animal fats or waste oils.

Advantages of Biodiesel


Renewable Resource: Produced from plant or animal sources, biodiesel is sustainable
and helps conserve fossil fuels.



Lower Emissions: Biodiesel combustion reduces the output of greenhouse gases,
particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and SOx compared to petroleum diesel.



Biodegradable and Safer: Less toxic and biodegradable, reducing environmental risks
in case of spills.



Engine Compatibility: Can be used in existing diesel engines with little or no
modification, and acts as a good lubricant, lowering wear.



Supports Agriculture: Provides a market for agricultural products, benefiting farmers
and rural communities.

Disadvantages of Biodiesel


Cold Flow Issues: Biodiesel may gel or become viscous at low temperatures, limiting
its use in cold climates without additives.



Feedstock Competition: Use of edible oils for fuel may compete with food supply,
raising ethical and economic concerns.



Storage Stability: Higher hygroscopicity (water absorption) and oxidative instability
can lead to fuel degradation if not stored properly.



Lower Energy Density: Biodiesel has slightly lower energy content per unit volume
compared to fossil diesel, resulting in marginally reduced vehicle mileage.



Production Costs: Depending on feedstock and technology, biodiesel can be more
expensive than conventional diesel.

Hydrogen as a Green Fuel
Hydrogen is a clean, zero-emission fuel that can be used for both energy storage and power
generation. When hydrogen is used in fuel cells or combusted in engines, the only byproduct
is water vapormaking it highly attractive for decarbonizing transportation, industry, and
electricity sectors.


Hydrogen has a high gravimetric energy density, storing more energy per unit mass
than most conventional fuels.



It can be produced from renewable resources, which enables energy independence and
supports climate goals.

Advantages of Hydrogen as a Green Fuel


Zero Emissions: Hydrogen fuel’s only exhaust is water vapor, eliminating CO₂, NOₓ,
and SOₓ emissions.



High Efficiency: Hydrogen fuel cells convert chemical energy directly to electricity
at efficiencies up to 60%, higher than most combustion engines.



Energy Storage and Grid Applications: Hydrogen stores surplus renewable energy,
balancing supply and demand, and serving as a backup during grid outages.



Versatile Uses: Hydrogen powers vehicles, trains, buildings, and industrial processes,
enabling broad adoption across the energy sector.



Rapid Refueling and Long Range: Hydrogen-powered vehicles refuel quickly and
offer longer driving range than many battery-electric vehicles.



Supports Decarbonization of Heavy Industry and Mobility: Enables cleaner
production in steel, ammonia, and transportation sectors.

Hydrogen Generation: Photocatalytic Water Splitting
Using TiO₂
Green hydrogen is produced via water splitting, a process that uses energy from renewable
sources to split water molecules into hydrogen (H₂) and oxygen (O₂). Photocatalytic water

splitting uses light (often solar) and photocatalysts such as titanium dioxide (TiO₂) to drive
this reaction without emitting carbon dioxide.

Principle:


TiO₂ is a semiconductor photocatalyst with a suitable band gap (~3.2 eV for anatase)
that absorbs ultraviolet light.





When TiO₂ is illuminated, it generates electron-hole pairs:
o

Electrons (e⁻) move to the conduction band.

o

Holes (h⁺) remain in the valence band.

Electrons reduce water to produce hydrogen:
2H+ + 2e− → H2



Holes oxidize water to produce oxygen:
2H2O + 4h+ →O2 + 4H+



Overall reaction:
2H2O



TiO2 and light

2H2+O2

TiO₂ is often modified (doped or combined with other materials) to improve visible
light absorption and hydrogen yield.

Steps in Photocatalytic Water Splitting:

1. Preparation of TiO₂-based photocatalyst (can be pure or doped for better
performance).
2. Suspension of the catalyst in water in a reactor.
3. Illumination with artificial or solar UV/visible light.
4. Collection and measurement of generated hydrogen and oxygen gases.

Production


Truly Green Production: Photocatalytic water splitting directly converts solar energy
and water into hydrogen and oxygen without any greenhouse gas emission, providing
a route to fully renewable fuel generation.



Abundant Inputs: The process uses water and sunlight—resources that are plentiful
and globally available—making it widely scalable and sustainable. Simple System
Design: Photocatalytic devices often have straightforward designs, requiring fewer
complex components than electrolyzers or fuel cells. This can lead to potential cost
savings and easy deployment.



No Need for External Bias: Unlike some other solar hydrogen production methods,
photocatalytic water splitting can proceed without an applied electrical bias if the
photocatalyst is properly engineered.



Environmentally Friendly: The process does not involve fossil fuels, thus reducing
harmful environmental impacts and supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.



Potential for Large-Scale Implementation: Advances in particulate semiconductor
catalyst technologies have enabled demonstration-scale outdoor panels and reaction
sheets for direct hydrogen generation.

Challenges of Photocatalytic Water Splitting H₂ Production


Low Solar-to-Hydrogen Efficiency: Most current photocatalytic systems have low
solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiencies, well below commercial viability.
Improving catalyst materials and reactor designs is a top research priority.



Photocatalyst Material Limitations: Catalysts like TiO₂ absorb mainly UV light,
which is only a small fraction of sunlight. Visible-light-responsive photocatalysts and
material modifications are under ongoing development.



Charge Carrier Recombination: Rapid recombination of electron-hole pairs before
they participate in water-splitting reactions greatly reduces H₂ yield. Designing
catalysts, co-catalysts, and reaction systems to facilitate charge separation is essential.



Product Separation and Safety: Safe and efficient separation of hydrogen and oxygen
to avoid explosive mixtures, and recovery of pure hydrogen from water-splitting
systems, remain practical engineering concerns.



Stability and Longevity: Many photocatalyst materials degrade under prolonged
operation or exposure to solar radiation, reducing the lifespan or requiring frequent
replacement.



Scalability and Cost: Achieving large-scale, cost-effective production of green
hydrogen while maintaining efficiency requires major advances in photovoltaic and
photocatalytic reactor-scale technologies.

Green Hydrogen Applications to Fuel cells
Green hydrogen, produced from renewable sources, is increasingly vital as a sustainable energy
carrier. Its major applications include transportation (fuel cell vehicles), stationary electricity
generation, industrial energy needs, backup power, and sector coupling for energy storage and
grid flexibility.

H₂-O₂ Fuel Cells: Principle and Operation
Hydrogen-oxygen (H₂-O₂) fuel cells are electrochemical devices that directly convert chemical
energy of hydrogen and oxygen into electricity, water, and heat with high efficiency and zero
harmful emissions.
A typical hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell schematic shows hydrogen entering at one side, splitting
into protons and electrons at the anode, protons crossing the electrolyte, electrons traveling
through the circuit (powering a load), and at the cathode, combining with oxygen to form water.

Construction


Electrodes: The cell has two electrodes: an anode (negative, typically porous carbon or
graphite, often with a catalyst like platinum) and a cathode (positive, similar structure).



Electrolyte: A proton-conducting membrane, usually a solid polymer electrolyte
(PEM), or in some variants, an alkaline solution such as KOH is used.



Reactants: Hydrogen gas is supplied to the anode, and oxygen (usually from air) is
supplied to the cathode.

Working Principle
Anode Reaction (Oxidation):
Hydrogen molecules enter at the anode, where a catalyst splits each H₂ into two protons (H⁺)
and two electrons (e⁻).


Anode Reaction: 2H2 → 4H+ + 4e−



Protons pass through the electrolyte membrane towards the cathode.



Electrons flow via an external circuit, generating electricity. This current can power
electrical devices.

Cathode Reaction (Reduction):
Oxygen gas arrives at the cathode. Here, oxygen combines with the incoming protons and
electrons to form water:


Cathode Reaction: O2 + 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2O

Overall Reaction:


Overall Cell Reaction: 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O + electricity + heat

The only byproducts are pure water (often as vapor) and a small amount of heat.
Fuel cells continuously generate power as long as hydrogen and oxygen are supplied, with
stacks used for higher voltage and power output. Modern fuel cell types include Proton
Exchange Membrane (PEM), Solid Oxide (SOFC), Phosphoric Acid (PAFC), and Alkaline
Fuel Cells, suitable for different engineering applications. This technology is pivotal for
sustainable power generation and forms the backbone of modern green hydrogen energy
systems.

Applications: Engineering and Industry


Transport: Hydrogen fuel cells power cars, buses, trains, trucks, ships, and even
aircraft, offering faster refueling and longer ranges compared to battery-electric
vehicles and making them suitable for heavy-duty, long-distance applications.



Stationary Power: Used for grid backup, off-grid electricity supply, data centers,
hospitals, telecom towers, warehouses, and commercial buildings due to high efficiency
and clean power.



Portable Devices: Fuel cells provide power for laptops, smartphones, unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs), campers, and portable generators.



Industrial Processes: Hydrogen fuel cells are increasingly used in steel manufacturing,
chemical production, and other sectors seeking decarbonized heat and power sources.



Special Applications: Used in spacecraft (NASA), submarines, and military for
uninterrupted and silent power supply.
